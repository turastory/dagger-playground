# Dagger Playground

After writing some production codes with Dagger, I felt I don't know well about Dagger.

Here's my goals:

- Comprehensive understanding of what Component, Module along with @Inject annotation means in higher level. I know what they do and how they work, of course, but I'm not sure WHY they should be made in that way.
- Discovering some best practices, especially in Android. One of them is injecting of ViewModel - or any business logic.
- What should I do to use Dagger within tests.
- more, more..
